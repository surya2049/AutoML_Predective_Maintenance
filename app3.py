# Welcome to the AUTOML APP FOR PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE

This application harnesses the power of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to enable users to predict maintenance needs based on their data. Our goal is to simplify the process of utilizing machine learning for predictive maintenance tasks, making it accessible to users with varying levels of expertise in data science.

## Key Features:

- **Data Upload:** Users can easily upload their dataset in CSV format. This data should reflect the operational metrics relevant to maintenance, such as equipment performance indicators, failure history, or other sensor readings.

- **Automated Exploratory Data Analysis:** Once your data is uploaded, the app provides an automated exploratory analysis using Sweetviz. This offers valuable insights into your data, including distribution, correlation, and missing values, helping you understand the dataset's characteristics before moving on to model training.

- **Auto Machine Learning:** With just a few clicks, users can train multiple machine learning models on their data. Our AutoML setup evaluates various models to find the one that best predicts maintenance needs. You don't need to worry about the complexities of model selection, parameter tuning, or performance evaluation; the app handles it all.

- **Model Evaluation and Download:** After training, the app displays the performance of the best model and allows users to download this model for future use. This enables easy integration of the predictive model into your maintenance planning processes.

## How to Navigate This App:

1. **Upload Your Data:** Start by uploading your dataset through the 'Upload Your Data' section. Ensure your data is in the correct format (CSV) and includes all necessary features for predictive maintenance.

2. **Explore Your Data:** Use the 'Automated Exploratory Data Analysis' section to get insights into your data's quality and characteristics. This step is crucial for understanding the dataset you're working with.

3. **Train Your Model:** Navigate to the 'Auto Machine Learning' section, select your target feature (the outcome you wish to predict), and train your model. The app will guide you through the process.

4. **Evaluate and Download the Model:** Review the performance of the best model in the 'Download Best Model' section. You can download the model for external use.
